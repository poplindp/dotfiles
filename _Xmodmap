! This is the cleanest version
!   xmodmap -pm gives the mapping
!

clear lock
remove control = Control_L

keycode 0x42 = Control_L

!maps CapsLock to ScrollLock just in case!
keycode 78=Caps_Lock
! dont do the sym, just map into Contro_L
!keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
!
add control = Control_L



!!! OLD.  Gives errors "bad keysym in..." since once Caps_Lock is removed
!!!       there is no more definition for it!.  Using the code (0x42) for
!!!       caps_locks make the trick
!
!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!remove Control = Control_L
!keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
!add Control = Control_L
